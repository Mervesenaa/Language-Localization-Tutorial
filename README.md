# Language-Localization-Tutorial

In this tutorial, I show you how to change the language in SwiftUI. There are 4 different languages ​​in the application: English (default language), Turkish, German and French. In the first page that opens, we have the user select the language and currency, when the user continues the application, we see that the application is in the language and currency selected by the user.
